# 1.2 Hello World: Breakdown
Let's do a further analysis of helloworld.c:

```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    main() {
    	printf("hello, world\n");
    }
```

This is the most basic code you can write, but it actually teaches us a lot.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

`#include` imports a header library, in this case, stdio.h. stdio.h and any other header files include functions, which, for our purpose, are basically just tools you can use for different things.

```c
main() {
```

This is the main function. As was stated earlier, this is the main tool. This is the implementation, or the code behind the tool.

```c
printf("hello, world\n");
```

`printf` is another function who's purpose is to print what is contained in the quotes on screen. the “\\n” at the end is the symbol for _newline_, which is similar to typing an _enter_ or _return_ key. The semicolon at the end is there to tell the parser that the line is over. While adding semicolons may seem like more of a downside, like many things in C, it will make a lot more sense later on.

> Note: Try removing the \\n from the end of the file and recompile it. Can you guess what will happen?

```c
}
```

All this line does is close the implementation of the main function. Whenever you open a bracket in C, you will almost always need to close it.
